          <h2>Lisinopril</h2>
          <p>
            Lisinopril is the generic drug name for Zestril. It is a blood
            pressure medication in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
            inhibitor group of drugs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doctors prescribe lisinopril to treat high blood pressure in adults
            and children 6 years old and older. People may also take lisinopril
            with other medications if they have heart failure. Doctors may also
            prescribe the drug for someone who has experienced a heart attack.

        <article class="info-medication border-bottom">
          <h2>Levothyroxine</h2>
          <p>
            People with hypothyroidism take levothyroxine (Synthroid). This
            medication is an artificial form of thyroxine (T4), a hormone that
            comes from the thyroid gland. T4 is low in people with
            hypothyroidism. Doctors may prescribe levothyroxine to adults and
            children, including newborns.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approves using
            levothyroxine for pituitary thyrotropin suppression in people with
            certain forms of thyroid cancer. Pituitary thyrotropin suppression
            helps prevent the growth of cancer cells.

      <section id="Atorvastatin">
        <article class="info-medication border-bottom">
          <h2>Atorvastatin</h2>
          <p>
            Statin therapies, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor), are the first-line
            treatment option for high cholesterol.
          </p>
          <p>
            They work by modifying how much cholesterol the body makes in the
            liver. Atorvastatin blocks enzymes in the liver responsible for
            making cholesterol.

      <section id="Metformin">
        <article class="info-medication border-bottom">
          <h2>Metformin</h2>
          <p>
            Metformin (Glucophage) is a diabetes medication. Doctors usually
            prescribe it as a first-line treatment option for people with a new
            diagnosis of the condition. This medication helps manageTrusted
            Source diabetes in several ways, including lowering how much sugar
            the liver produces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, it lowers the amount of sugar the intestines absorb.
            Metformin also makes insulin more sensitive to circulating sugar.
            With diabetes, the bodyâ€™s insulin does not function well, but
            metformin can help improve its function.

      <section id="Simvastatin">
        <article class="info-medication">
          <h2>Simvastatin</h2>
          <p>
            Simvastatin (Zocor) is another statin drug. It works in the same way
            as atorvastatin, and doctors prescribe it for the same reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            In comparison with atorvastatin, doctors usually prescribe
            simvastatin for nighttime use. However, both drugs share drug
            interactions. Additionally, people should not takeTrusted Source
            simvastatin with gemfibrozil (Lopid) because of the risk of a severe
            muscle disorder called rhabdomyolysis.
